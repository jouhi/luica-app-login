### The Part That Kept Me Growing
Even though I'm a bit flawed in my coding part, I managed to understand the framework flow and steps thanks to helpful YouTube tutorials. This gave me a confidence boost to work with real-world authentication.

###  What I done 
- Basic login page style  
- Fixed a minor bug in session handling ‚Äî pulling my hair and getting frustrated because of how amazing this framework is

**Before starting,**  
it helps to break down the process into three concepts:

### üîê Authentication  
Verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.

### üóÇÔ∏è Session Management  
Tracks the user's auth state across requests.

### üîì Authorization  
Decides what routes and data the user can access.
